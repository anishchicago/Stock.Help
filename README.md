# Stock.Help

This was a project submitted in Oct 2018 for the Factom Hackathon in Chicago. Factom is a public blockchain which stores a state of itself periodically on the Bitcoin chain: https://www.factom.com/factom-blockchain/

The premise is to record stock analyst predictions and monitor their performance on the Factom chain vis-a-vis actual stock performance.
